Ekawada!
========

"Ekawada!" is a web application for categorizing, analyzing, comparing, and learning
string figures.

The term "ekawada" is Nauruan for "string figure". Why Nauru? The Nauruan culture was
well known for the extremely elaborate string figures it produced.

Purpose
-------

While the primary purpose behind Ekawada! is, as said above, to aid research into
string figures, it was also written to help me learn [Rails 3](http://rubyonrails.org).
As a result, the implementation is a bit "iffy" in places, as I'm working to learn
best practices for Rails 3 (in particular, so-called "Unobtrusive Javascript", which
Rails 3 has adopted with open arms).

Getting Started
---------------

Information on getting started with Ekawada is pending more research. You need to do
some stuff with bundler, then some stuff to initialize your database. Then you can
optionally run the "db:seed" rake task to get a default set of starter data.
