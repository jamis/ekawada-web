- don't give a 404 when a make instruction specifies a construction that can't be found. the create should succeed, but render with error message inline in the instructions.
- show a spinner when adding an illustration
- sorting figures should ignore articles at the start of a figure's name (e.g. "A Fish-Spear")
- design a real figures index

- allow "make" references in constructions to be expanded
- edit sources
- delete sources
- edit figure_sources
- delete figure_sources
- disallow figure deletion if it or any of its constructions are referenced in another figure
- disallow construction deletion if it is referenced in another figure
- reorder illustrations
- allow source to be specified at figure creation
- display whether a figure is an opening, ending, or maneuver
- filter index by notation
- illustration thumbnails during edit/create don't line up well on a second row (see "A Sea-Snake")
- allow figures to be referenced/hyperlinked from within instructions and comments (but not as a "make" link) (see "A Sea-Snake", CFJ, steps 4 and 5)
