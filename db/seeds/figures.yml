        1. Place loop on thumbs.
        2. Insert left index proximally into thumb loop and return with left ulnar thumb string. You now have a short string passing between the left thumb and index.
        3. Bring hands together and pass right index distal to the short string described above. Hook back this string with the right index. Rotate the right index half a turn in the ulnar direction in order to place the string on the back of the finger.
